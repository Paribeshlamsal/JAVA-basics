a) MIN_PRIORITY -------- 1
b)NORM_PRIORITY --------5
c)MAX_PRIORITY ---------10

--Thread with higher priorities are more important to a program and should be allocated processor time before the low priority thread.
--The methods in the thread class getPriority and setPriority are used to get and set the priorities of the threads respectively.
